Apologies coudn't finish this excercise in designated time. My knowledge of python and programming concepts are awesome. But I have created a ETL pipeline in python before. But I understand the concepts of ETL and its architecture very well.
My Plan below
Extraction:
•	Files: Read data from CSV, JSON, Excel, or other file formats using pandas (e.g., pd.read_csv(), pd.read_json()).
Transformation:
•	Data Cleaning: Handle missing values (df.fillna(), df.dropna()), remove duplicates (df.drop_duplicates()), correct data types (df.astype()).
•	Data Manipulation: Filter rows (df[df['column'] > value]), select/rename columns, aggregate data (df.groupby().agg()), merge/join dataframes (pd.merge()).
•	Create the star schema
Loading:
•	Files: Save data to various file formats using pandas (e.g., df.to_csv(), df.to_json()).
